# tictactoe

I'll be creating a tic tac toe game with 2 players using my usual technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

For now, each player will have a separate term and will work as any normal game of tic tac toe would.

I scrapped the AI idea, as I need to move on to a new project. I figured I'd have more ambitious projects in the future, rather than focusing on making this simple tic tac toe game the best.
